## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I got much better understanding of flexbox and css layout.

```css
.wrapper {
  max-width: 350px;
  margin: auto;
  background-color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 3px 10px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2);
}
```

```css
main {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to foucs css grid layout and flexbox further in the future.
